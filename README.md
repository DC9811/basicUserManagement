#Basic User Management
Good day!

This project provides the basic features of a User Management system with CRUD operations, using Lumen (Backend) and Laravel 8 (Frontend).

The scope of the User Management system includes the following:
1. The Admin cannot update their own account for security reasons.
2. There are only two roles: Admin and User.
3. By default, every newly registered user is assigned the User role.

The ideal scope of the User Management system includes the following:
1. Users can update their own account, but only their name.
2. The Admin can create additional roles and assign access to use different pages (Admin and User Pages).

The possible issues of the current User Management system include the following:
1. There is no middleware implemented.

The Admin login credentials:
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: Asdf1234*

I believe there may still be some vulnerabilities or unhandled errors due to time constraints. 
However, I hope this serves as a solid starting point for a more complete User Management system.
